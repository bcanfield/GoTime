## üìñ About the Game

GoTime is a proof-of-concept implementation of the ancient board game Go. It demonstrates how SpacetimeDB can be used to create responsive multiplayer experiences with complex game logic.

The repository contains:
- A client app written in [React](https://react.dev/)  
- A server app written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

For the rules of Go, see our [GO_RULES.md](/GO_RULES.md) document or visit one of the many excellent online resources for learning the game.
